    <h2>Grouping and Aggregation</h2>

    To do a simple grouping, provide the keys you want to group by into the grid options.
    There is no limit on the number of keys that can be used.
    Grouping can be done on any attribute of the rows, grouping does not have to use
    an attribute that is used by a column.

    <p/>

    The grid option group parameters are as follows:
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupKeys</th>
            <td>An array of 1 or more strings, each entry an item to group by. Leave blank, or empty array, for no grouping.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupUseEntireRow</th>
            <td>If grouping, set to true or false (default is false). If true, group row will use all columns spanning the entire
                width of the table. If false, only the first column will be used to display the group, and the remaining
                columns will render as normal. If no aggregation function (groupAggFunction) is defined, then the additional cells
                in the group row will be blank. If an aggregation function is defined, then the result of the aggregation will be
                used for values in the remaining cells. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupInnerCellRenderer</th>
            <td>If grouping, allows custom rendering of the group cell. Use this if you are not  happy with the default
                presentation of the group. This is only used when groupUseEntireRow=true.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupDefaultExpanded</th>
            <td>If grouping, set to true, false or a number (default is false). If true, when data is loaded, groups will be expanded by default.
            If false, they won't. If a number, then the first n levels will be expanded, eg 0 for none, 1 first level only, etc.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupAggFunction</th>
            <td>If grouping, used to create aggregates. The aggregation function takes an array of rows and should return
                one row that's an aggregate of the passed rows. For example, if each row has a field called 'price', and
                you want the total price, then return an object with the total price in a field 'price'. This will then
                get rendered in the price column on in the group row.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>groupIncludeFooter</th>
            <td>If grouping, whether to show a group footer when the group is expanded. If true, then by default, the footer
                will container aggregate data (if any) when shown and the header will be black. When closed, the header will
                contain the aggregate data regardless of this setting (as footer is hidden anyway).
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Grouping Example</h3>

    Below shows a simple grouping example, using one attribute to group, the entire row is used and no aggregation function.

    <show-example example="example1"></show-example>

    <h3>Grouping with Aggregation</h3>

    Below shows a more complex example, using aggregation to sum the number of medals for each country.

    <show-example example="example2"></show-example>

    <h3>Multi-Level Grouping with Aggregation</h3>

    Even more complicated, multiple levels of grouping and aggregation.

    <p/>
    When aggregating rows in multi-level, the rows been aggregated can contain aggregation rows themselves.
    This is checked using the 'group' property on the node. If it is set, then that row
    is a group row and has attributes relevant to the group. When aggregating, the results of
    the aggregation for the group is stored in the node attribute data.

    <show-example example="example3"></show-example>

    <h3>Grouping Footers</h3>

    <p>
        If you want to include a footer with each group, set the property <i>groupIncludeFooter</i> to true.
        The footer is displayed as the last line of the group when then group is expanded - it is not displayed
        when the group is collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The footer will display the word 'Total' followed by the group key.
    </p>
    <p>
        When showing the groups in one column, the aggregation data is displayed
        in the group header when collapsed, and only in the footer when expanded (ie it moves from the header
        to the footer). To have different rendering, provide a custom <i>groupInnerCellRenderer</i>, where
        the renderer can check if it's a header or footer.
    </p>

    <show-example example="groupingFooters"></show-example>

    <h3>Recomputing Aggregates</h3>

    <p>
        If the data changes after the aggregation is done, you can tell the grid to recompute the aggregates.
        This is through throw the api method <i>recomputeAggregates</i>. For example, if you allow editing,
        and want the aggregates to update as new values are edited, then create code like the following:

        <pre>
        // add a listener to the editable colDef
        colDef.cellValueChanged = function() {
            gridOptions.api.recomputeAggregates();
        }
        </pre>

    </p>


    <h3>Advanced Multi-Level Grouping</h3>

    When doing aggregations, it is not always possible to just 'sum' the values, especially if they
    are not number values. The example below shows a complex custom aggregation over age giving
    a min and a max age. The grouping row is also styled in bold.

    <show-example example="example4"></show-example>

    <h3>Group Row Rendering</h3>

    It is possible to override the rendering of the group row. Below shows an example of aggregating,
    then using the entire row to give a summary.

    <show-example example="example5"></show-example>

    <h3>Custom Expand / Contract Icons</h3>

    See the section on icons for customising the expand / contract icons.
